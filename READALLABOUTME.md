# hello-world
My first Github Repository! 

My goals, the skills I want to learn, and helpful information! 
I want to become more comfortable with using Github. I got a degree in Electrical Engineering, but I had difficulties finding a 
desired career goal within that path. 

Starting in September 2024, I will be living in Baltimore, MD. I will look into obtaining a Help Desk Technician, Network Engineer, or System Administration role within a government agency/government contractor to obtain a 
security clearance and further my goal of getting into Cyber Security. 

Update: June 2024
