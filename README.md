# hello-world
My first Github Repository! My goals, the skills I want to learn, and helpful information! 
I want to become more comfortable with using Github. I got a degree in Electrical Engineering, but I had difficulties finding a 
desired career goal within that path. Hopefully, in the next few months, I have a better idea of what I want to do. For example, DevOps Engineering, Network Engineering, System Administration, Cloud Engineering, Data Analytics are types of jobs that spark my interest. 
Learning the basics to get a beginner job title (0 years of experience) and work up from there. Remote is a must for me. 

Update: February 2024

After some time to determine my career, I have found a new interest in pursuing IT / Cybersecurity. I have 1 year of Network Technician experience, 4x CompTIA certifications, 1x AWS certification, and several more in-progress. 

Looking for the next job to propel me into Cybersecurity!
