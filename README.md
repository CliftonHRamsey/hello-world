# hello-world
My first Github Repository! My goals, my skills I want to learn, and helpful information! 
I want to become more comfortable with using Github. I got a degree in Electrical Engineering, but I had difficulties finding a 
desired career goal within that path. Hopefully, in the next few months I have a better idea of what I want to do. For example, DevOpS Engineering, Network Engineering, System Administration, Cloud Engineering, Data Analytics are types of jobs that spark my interest. 
Learning the basics in order to get a begineer job title (0 years of experience) and work up from there. Remote is a must for me.
